=======================
Client - Common - Alert
=======================

The Alert component is used to give feedback to actions made by the users.

The Alert can also provide the opportunity to the user to cancel the action (e.g. cancel removal, cancel creation) or to
retry the last action (e.g. if something bad happened before, we can retry the last action)
